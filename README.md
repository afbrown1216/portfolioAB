## Description 

This page is a portfolio to showcase my Web Development skills to employers.
I will continue to make the code cleaner and add new things as I learn and grow 
my developer skills. Others can use this to see my progress overtime and also share 
tips on how to make things better. 

While creating this page I used Bootstrap classes and grid system. Bootstrap made the page 
dynamic, mobile ready and easy to include simple css styling to the webpage. I had some difficulty 
with the grid on the portfolio page but eventauuly figured out sub rows in rows. 

I was not able to make my footer sticky constiently and will update once I find the correct method.
